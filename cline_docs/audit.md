# Security Audit Report

## Overview

This report outlines the findings of a security audit conducted on the Snowsparrow application. The audit focused on identifying potential security vulnerabilities, performance inefficiencies, and other issues that could impact the application's stability and security.

## Findings

### Authentication Security

- **Issue**: API routes and auth callback are excluded from authentication checks in `middleware.ts`.
  - **Potential Solution**: Implement authentication checks within each API route to ensure only authorized users can access them. Review the logic in the auth callback to ensure it is secure and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.

- **Issue**: The `app/api/chat/route.ts` file uses `createClient(true)` to create a Supabase client with the service role, bypassing RLS.
  - **Potential Solution**: Review the usage of the service role in this file. Ensure that it is only used when absolutely necessary and that RLS policies are in place to protect the data. Consider using a more granular approach to access control, such as defining specific roles and permissions for different users.

### Data Protection

- **Issue**: The `isValidBase64Image` function in `app/api/storage/route.ts` only checks the file size and PNG signature but doesn't perform any other validation on the image data.
  - **Potential Solution**: Implement more robust image validation techniques, such as using a library to parse the image data and verify its integrity. Consider using a virus scanner to scan the uploaded image for malicious content.

### API Security

### Client-side Vulnerabilities

### Performance Optimization

- **Issue**: Inefficient data fetching and sorting in `app/api/saved-items/route.ts`. The code fetches both conversations and flowcharts and then sorts them in memory.
  - **Potential Solution**: Modify the database queries to fetch the data sorted directly from the database. This will reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in memory and improve performance.

- **Issue**: Short validity of signed URLs for flowcharts in `app/api/saved-items/route.ts` (60 seconds).
  - **Potential Solution**: Increase the validity of the signed URLs to reduce the frequency of regeneration. Consider using a longer validity period, such as 1 hour or 1 day, depending on the application's requirements.

### Other Security Considerations

## Conclusion

This report provides a summary of the security audit findings and recommendations for addressing identified issues. Implementing these recommendations will help improve the overall security and stability of the Snowsparrow application.
