# Project Brief

## Overview

Building a web app, named Snowsparrow, that will house a lot of little AI powered tools for a public K-12 school district. The first feature is a Mermaid flowchart creation tool that translates a description of a workflow and outputs a graphical flow chart

In the future there will be many more little AI tools built out that users will have access to. When designing the app, keep that in mind.

## Core Features

- The first feature simply takes a plain english description of a work flow, sends it on to OpenRouter via API, gets back Mermaid flowchart code, renders a Mermaid flow chart, that can be saved as a png file and downloaded by the user.

## Target Users

Employees of a K-12 public school district looking for useful AI tools to help them be more efficient without spending too much time thinking about how to use AI.

## Technical Preferences

- Next.js 15+ - App Router version
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Supabase (for database, storage and authentication)
- Vercel for deployment
- Repo on Github
