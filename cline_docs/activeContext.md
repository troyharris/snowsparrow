- Database-driven models configuration for AI tools

## Recent Changes

- Created AI service layer:
  - Database-driven model configuration in lib/ai/config/models.ts
  - Prompt templates in lib/ai/prompts/mermaid.ts and handbook.ts
  - OpenRouter client in lib/ai/clients/openrouter.ts
  - Models API endpoint for CRUD operations
  - Admin interface for model management
- Created shared UI components:
  - Button with variants
  - Card with header and content sections
  - Select dropdown
  - Textarea with error states
  - LoadingSpinner
  - ErrorMessage
  - SuccessMessage
  - ChatInterface for AI interactions
- Added Employee Handbook AI tool:
  - Handbook-specific prompts
  - Reusable chat interface
  - API endpoint
- Implemented storage integration:
  - Created 'flowcharts' storage bucket
  - Added storage API route
  - Implemented save functionality
  - Added loading and error states
- Enhanced database access security:
  - Modified Supabase client to support service role access when needed
  - Updated API routes to use service role for accessing protected tables
  - Implemented middleware bypass for API routes
  - Fixed row-level security issues with prompts table

## Active Decisions

- Using shared ChatInterface component for AI tools
- Implementing storage integration for saving user content
- Standardizing error handling patterns
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Following component-based architecture
- Moving configuration to database for flexibility

## Current Considerations

### Technical

- Storage access policies configuration
- Testing implementation strategy
- Component reusability and composition
- Error handling patterns
- State management strategies
- Performance optimization
- Database schema design for configuration
- Admin interface access control

### Product

- User experience consistency
- Error message clarity
- Loading state feedback
- Component documentation
- Design system evolution
- Storage integration UX

## Next Steps

1. Complete storage integration:

   - Set up storage access policies
   - Test storage functionality
   - Document storage integration

2. Expand database-driven configuration:

   - Move system prompts to database
   - Create admin interfaces for prompt management
   - Implement versioning for prompts and models

3. Implement testing:

   - Set up testing framework
   - Write component tests
   - Write service tests
   - Write API route tests
   - Implement error boundaries

4. Enhance documentation:

   - API documentation
   - User guide
   - Testing documentation
   - Storage integration docs
   - Best practices

5. Consider additional features:
   - User dashboard
   - Activity history
   - Additional AI tools

## Open Questions

- Testing strategy implementation
- Additional shared components needed
- State management optimization
- Performance monitoring approach
- User feedback collection methods
