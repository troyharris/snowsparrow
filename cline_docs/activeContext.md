## Current Work Focus

Addressing the security audit finding that API routes and the auth callback are excluded from authentication checks in `middleware.ts`, while ensuring authentication-related routes remain accessible.

## Recent Changes

- Modified `middleware.ts` to remove the blanket bypass for `/api/` and `/auth/callback`.
- Implemented authentication checks in all API routes using the `isAuthenticated` function.
- Added validation for the `next` parameter in `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
- Created a specific list of public paths in middleware that don't require authentication:
  - `/login` - The login page itself
  - `/api/nonce` - Required for Google One Tap authentication
  - `/auth/callback` - OAuth callback handling
  - `/auth/confirm` - Email confirmation handling
  - `/auth/signout` - Sign out functionality
- Fixed a foreign key constraint issue in prompt deletion functionality:
  - When deleting a prompt, the system now first updates any related conversations to set their prompt_id to null
  - This resolves the Supabase error 409 (foreign key constraint violation) that occurred when trying to delete prompts that were referenced by conversations
  - Implemented the fix in both the client-side DeletePromptButton component and the server-side DELETE API route
- Fixed a potential crash on the login page (`app/login/page.tsx`) by wrapping `decodeURIComponent` calls for the `error` query parameter in `try...catch` blocks. This prevents errors if the parameter is malformed.
- Corrected the nonce generation logic in `app/api/nonce/route.ts` to safely convert random bytes to a binary string before Base64 encoding, resolving potential "SyntaxError: The string did not match the expected pattern" errors related to `btoa`.

## Next Steps

- Test the authentication flow thoroughly to ensure all paths work correctly.
- Verify that Google One Tap authentication works properly with the updated middleware.
- Consider adding more specific public paths if other authentication-related functionality is identified.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The nonce should be generated on the server-side to ensure the integrity of the nonce and prevent it from being manipulated by an attacker.
- Authentication-related endpoints must remain accessible without authentication to avoid circular dependencies in the auth flow.
- We're using a whitelist approach for public paths rather than a pattern-based exclusion to maintain better security control.
- Implemented a delete functionality for prompts in the admin prompts page, ensuring only admins can delete prompts. Moved the delete logic to a client component to fix the "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" error. Modified the error message to be a generic message.
