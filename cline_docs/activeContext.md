# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Refactoring and improving code organization
- Creating reusable UI components
- Implementing AI service layer
- Enhancing error handling and validation
- Standardizing component patterns

## Recent Changes

- Created AI service layer:
  - Model configuration in lib/ai/config/models.ts
  - Prompt templates in lib/ai/prompts/mermaid.ts
  - OpenRouter client in lib/ai/clients/openrouter.ts
- Created shared UI components:
  - Button with variants
  - Card with header and content sections
  - Select dropdown
  - Textarea with error states
  - LoadingSpinner
  - ErrorMessage
  - SuccessMessage
- Added input validation for Mermaid API
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Documented shared components

## Active Decisions

- Using shared components for consistent UI
- Implementing AI service layer for future tools
- Standardizing error handling patterns
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Following component-based architecture

## Current Considerations

### Technical

- Expanding AI service layer for future tools
- Component reusability and composition
- Error handling patterns
- State management strategies
- Performance optimization

### Product

- User experience consistency
- Error message clarity
- Loading state feedback
- Component documentation
- Design system evolution

## Next Steps

1. Review and test shared components
2. Document component usage patterns
3. Implement remaining UI improvements:
   - Loading states
   - Error boundaries
   - Success feedback
4. Add unit tests for:
   - Shared components
   - AI service layer
   - API routes
5. Consider additional shared components:
   - Form components
   - Layout components
   - Navigation components
6. Enhance documentation:
   - Component API references
   - Usage examples
   - Best practices

## Open Questions

- Additional shared components needed
- Testing strategy for components
- State management needs
- Performance optimization opportunities
