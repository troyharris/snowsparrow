## Current Work Focus

Modifying the `ChatInterface.tsx` file to send the conversation to AI and ask it to create a summary title instead of using the user's input directly.

## Recent Changes

- Added a function called `generateConversationTitle` to call the AI model to generate a summary title.
- Called the `generateConversationTitle` function inside the `onClick` handler of the "Save" button, before saving the conversation to the database.
- Updated the `title` property in the request body of the `fetch` call to use the generated title.
- Updated the `onClick` handler of the "Save Conversation" button to update the `conversationTitle` state with the generated title before showing the title input.

## Next Steps

- Update the memory bank files to reflect the changes made.
- Test the changes to ensure that the conversation title is generated correctly and displayed in the TitleInput box.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The `generateConversationTitle` function uses the `apiEndpoint` to send the request to the AI model. This endpoint should be configured correctly to ensure that the request is sent to the correct AI model.
- The `generateConversationTitle` function returns a default title ("Untitled Conversation") if it fails to generate a title. This fallback title should be updated to a more informative title.
