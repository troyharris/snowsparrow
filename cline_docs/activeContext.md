# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Implementing storage integration for Mermaid flowcharts
- Expanding AI tools with Employee Handbook feature
- Refining shared component architecture
- Enhancing error handling and validation
- Testing and documentation improvements
- Modified authentication flow to redirect to homepage after login/signup

## Recent Changes

- Created AI service layer:
  - Model configuration in lib/ai/config/models.ts
  - Prompt templates in lib/ai/prompts/mermaid.ts and handbook.ts
  - OpenRouter client in lib/ai/clients/openrouter.ts
- Created shared UI components:
  - Button with variants
  - Card with header and content sections
  - Select dropdown
  - Textarea with error states
  - LoadingSpinner
  - ErrorMessage
  - SuccessMessage
  - ChatInterface for AI interactions
- Added Employee Handbook AI tool:
  - Handbook-specific prompts
  - Reusable chat interface
  - API endpoint
- Implemented storage integration:
  - Created 'flowcharts' storage bucket
  - Added storage API route
  - Implemented save functionality
  - Added loading and error states

## Active Decisions

- Using shared ChatInterface component for AI tools
- Implementing storage integration for saving user content
- Standardizing error handling patterns
- Using TypeScript for type safety
- Following component-based architecture

## Current Considerations

### Technical

- Storage access policies configuration
- Testing implementation strategy
- Component reusability and composition
- Error handling patterns
- State management strategies
- Performance optimization

### Product

- User experience consistency

- Storage integration UX

## Next Steps

1. Complete storage integration:

   - Set up storage access policies
   - Test storage functionality
   - Document storage integration

2. Implement testing:

   - Set up testing framework
   - Write component tests
   - Write service tests
   - Write API route tests
   - Implement error boundaries

3. Enhance documentation:

   - API documentation
   - User guide
   - Testing documentation
   - Storage integration docs
   - Best practices

4. Consider additional features:
   - User dashboard
   - Activity history
   - Additional AI tools

## Open Questions
