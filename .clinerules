# Project Configuration

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15+ with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for backend
- Vercel for deployment
- GitHub for version control

## Project Structure

- - /app # Next.js App Router pages
  - /components # React components
  - /lib # Utility functions
  - /types # TypeScript types
  - /utils/supabase # Auth createClient modules for both client and server, as well as middleware
- /supabase
  - /migrations # SQL migration files
  - /seed # Seed data files
- /public # Static assets

## Database Migrations

SQL files in /supabase/migrations should:

- Use sequential numbering: 001, 002, etc.
- Include descriptive names
- Be reviewed by Cline before execution
  Example: 001_create_users_table.sql

## Development Workflow

- Cline helps write and review code changes
- Vercel automatically deploys from main branch
- Database migrations reviewed by Cline before execution

## Security

DO NOT read or modify:

- .env files
- \*_/config/secrets._
- Any file containing API keys or credentials

## Authentication

- Middleware is used to protect all routes by checking for an authenticated user session.
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to the /login page.
- The `isAuthenticated` function in `utils/supabase/middleware.ts` checks for a valid Supabase session.
