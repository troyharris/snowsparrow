# Snowsparrow

Snowsparrow is a web application designed to provide K-12 public school district employees with easy-to-use AI tools that enhance their work efficiency. The platform aims to make AI technology accessible without requiring deep technical knowledge.

## Features

### Mermaid Flowchart Creator

The initial feature is a Mermaid flowchart creation tool that takes a plain English description of a workflow and generates a visual flowchart. Users can input their workflow description, and the tool will automatically generate a corresponding Mermaid flowchart code, render it visually, and allow users to download the flowchart as a PNG file.

### Future AI Tools

Snowsparrow is built with the intention of housing multiple AI tools in the future. Each tool will follow the same principles of simplicity and ease of use, focusing on practical applications for the education sector.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
